README

1)    [group_7_finalproject.zip] A group project in 2018 in JavaFX while we were learning the SDLC. We produced a Snake arcade-style game. My effort was focused on the interface and database for keeping the scores, but I also assisted in the code of the final version of the game itself. I have attached all our final deliverables. You can read the text file and run setup to play it.
2)    [promise12_UNet] This Colab notebook is from an assignment from one of my graduate courses at Queen’s. It will run a UNet model that learns to segment prostate regions from CT scans. You will have to download the data folder on your own Google Drive account to run the notebook. You will also need to change the directory location at the top of the notebook to match your directory structure, and enable Colab’s GPU hardware accelerator in the Change Runtime Type menu.
3)    [assignment2_COIS2020.zip] I have also included a simple job and interrupt simulation in C# from my first data structures course. It will ask for job runtimes and arrival times in seconds. I have included the testing, source code and an executable version of the program.
